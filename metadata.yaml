description: "An Englishwoman's Love-letters is a 1900 novel by Laurence Housman,\
  \ initially published anonymously. It was a scandal in its time due to its frankness,\
  \ which excitement turned to disappointment as the public learned the author was\
  \ no Englishwoman but Housman. One year later, in 1901, a parody of the book, entitled\
  \ Another Englishwoman's Love-letters and written by Barry Pain, was published by\
  \ T. Fisher Unwin.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
